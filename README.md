# MagTagStatus

This takes my "status" from a Adafruit MagTag and sends it to an MQTT feed at Adafruit.IO.

The "status" tracks "Sporks so give," but it could be something a little more adult. At some point I'll post the code for a web page that grabs the status and does something with it.

The original code was an example from Adafruit, and I intent to keep the MIT license intact, if I can figure out how to do so.
